    <p>“Always functional” means that if I was experiencing these symptoms, I would be in pain, but capable of hiding it.</p>
    <p>There are only four molybdenum-dependant enzymes in humans: xanthine oxidase, ferrodoxin, sulphite oxidase, and nitrate reductase. I suspect that I have a molybdenum processing disorder, but it doesn't really make sense. I have no symptoms of nitrate reductase deficiency (higher met-haemoglobin in the blood) and if I have xanthine oxidase deficiency, I should have trouble with a number of purine-rich foods, including pork and cheese, which I don't. Ferrodoxin might explain the citric acid sensitivity, but then how am I not dead? Admittedly, the deficiency must be small and the biochemistry must be complicated. This is my best hypothesis, but there aren't many tests I can do on my own at this point.</p>
    <p>It's also worth noting that lactose-intolerance is wild-type and lactose-tolerance is the mutant phenotype.</p>
    <h1>The Elimination Diet</h1>
    <p>This is the elimination diet I followed to determine my sensitivities. My sister also used it and discovered she is sensitive to wheat, pork, and the mint-family herb. It's a composite of many I found online. Keep a journal of what you eat, approximate times, bowel movements, and any GI discomfort.</p>
    <h2>Elimination</h2>
    <p>For two weeks (though plan for three since you will probably make mistakes the first week), eat only the following foods. You should have no symptoms at the end of those weeks.</p>
    <p><b>Beans</b> – green beans, wax beans, dried beans, chickpeas, lentils, peas, dried peas<br/>
<b>Beet Family</b> – beets, beet greens, Swiss chard<br/>
<b>Cabbage Family</b> – cabbage, bok choy, napa cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, rapini, broccolini, mustard greens, collard greens, kholrobi<br/>
<b>Carrot Family</b> – carrots, parsnips, parsley, celery, celery root<br/>
<b>Cooking Ingredients</b> – tapioca starch, white vinegar<br/>
<b>Fruits</b> – olives, blueberries, grapes, apples, pears, dates, apple juice/cider/sauce if unsweetened<br/>
<b>Grains</b> – Rice, quinoa, amaranth, millet<br/>
<b>Lilly Family</b> – onions, garlic, shallots, leeks<br/>
<b>Nuts</b> – almonds, sesame, walnuts, coconut, sunflower seeds (and their oils and butters)<br/>
<b>Poultry</b> – chicken, turkey, duck, goose<br/>
<b>Seasonings</b> – salt, black pepper, ginger (fresh or dried), olive oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, most herbs and spices<br/>
<b>Squash</b> – zucchini, pumpkin, butternut squash, acorn squash, turban squash, etc.<br/>
Fish<br/>
Lamb<br/>
Mushrooms<br/>
Spinach<br/>
Sweet potato</p>
    <p>No sweeteners other than rice syrup. Rice milk is also acceptable if you can find one that contains only rice, water, and enzyme.</p>
    <h2>Reintroduction</h2>
    <p>When reintroducting, eat two servings a day for two days. Basically, put some of the target food in two different meals everyday. You should experience nothing noticeable. The order doesn't matter, though some things must be tested in order. If an item is marked with a ★, then it should be the target food for testing.</p>
